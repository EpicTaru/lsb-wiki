Contributors to Project Topaz are expected to abide by the following Code of Conduct.

# 0. Official Discord Code of Conduct
The official GitHub [Terms of Use](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service) and [Community Guidelines](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines), and Partnership Code of Conduct are incorporated into our rules, and will be enforced.

# 1. Non-FFXI Topics
There are many places on the internet you can discuss sex, people's appearance, race, religion, cars, politics, and any other number of non-FFXI topics. This is not one of them. We are not here to talk about what people believe about non-FFXI subjects, who they vote for, or anything else that does not have to do specifically with FFXI. There are a million other places on the internet, and in the rest of the world to discuss the other things. Go do it somewhere else.

# 2. Toxic Behavior
Many of you may have come from project environments or private servers that have a relaxed attitude of "it's just a joke," "man up," or "white knights are cancer." This is not that place. Project Topaz wants every member of the community to feel welcome and valued. Therefore, the following toxic behaviors are unacceptable:

- Disparaging comments about individuals or groups
- "Jokes" involving sex, genitals, or sexual abuse
- Offensive memes or emojis
- Other unprofessional content that belittles, intimidates, or otherwise disrespects our members

We would rather have the new contributors be comfortable, and create a welcoming environment for everyone, than cater to people, however knowledgeable, who wish to denigrate and belittle others.

# 3. Community
Project Topaz feels that everyone has a role to play in working towards our shared love of emulating and preserving FFXI. Do not make disparaging comments, even in jest, about servers or other codebases. These only upset people who have worked hard on that server or codebase. You never know when someone from that server you mocked will want to contribute to us, but we'll lose them when they see us insulting them behind their backs. Please treat members of other communities like they're one of our own, because they might be one day.
