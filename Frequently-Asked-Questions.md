## What is Darkstar Project / DSP?
Darkstar Project was the most-recent FFXI server codebase which Project Topaz forked from. It is no longer being developed.

## What works?
https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/wiki/What-Works

## When will feature X arrive?
We practice [clean room engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design), which means we have to implement everything from scratch. As such, progress is slow. We are also trying to balance feature development, bugfixes, performance improvements, exploit resolution, code review, and testing.

## Can I pay someone to implement feature X?
We will never accept financial or material incentives for our work. This is a hobby project. External incentives would drive developer and staff time in a way that makes it no longer a hobby.

## I heard Topaz is interested in modules and customization?

## When can I play "Classic" Dynamis?
You can't, it isn't in the game anymore.

"Classic" Dynamis was removed from the game in 2011. The spawn mechanisms as you remember them are gone from the game, and those zones no longer act the way they used to. The overall project goal is to emulate the retail game as closely as possible, so a massive custom solution to approximate "Classic" Dynamis is not on our roadmap.


However, in 2017 Dynamis Divergence was released, a content level 149 version of the "Classic" Dynamis players wanted to experience again. If we were to support a custom Dynamis solution, it would be the implementation of Dynamis Divergence and a set of mods or switches that scale it down to level 75 era difficulty.


Keep in mind that we haven't completed all content up to 2007, so a full implementation of content from 2017 with mods on top isn't coming any time soon.
