## What is Darkstar Project / DSP?
Darkstar Project was the most-recent FFXI server codebase which Project Topaz forked from. It is no longer being developed.

## What works?
https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/wiki/What-Works

## When will feature X arrive?
We practice [clean room engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design), which means we have to implement everything from scratch. As such, progress is slow.

## Can I pay someone to implement feature X?
We will never accept financial or material incentives for our work. This is a hobby project. External incentives would drive developer and staff time in a way that makes it no longer a hobby.

## When can I play "Classic" Dynamis?
You can't, it isn't in the game anymore.
