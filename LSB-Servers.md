# Dawnbreak:
75 cap and Generally Wings of The Goddess era with some customization/quality of life improvements. (may change cap in the future, but if raised, the leveling experience will still be like it was in Wings of the Goddess - Abyssea burns / books burns won't be a thing. Community will decide.)

Exp and skillup rates boosted. Limited Trusts. Partying with humans is still preferred. Unrestricted level sync enabled. Conquest system modified to boost weaker nations regional influence. Inventory such as wardrobes are unlocked and expended by custom means. Explorer moogle enabled at level 1. 99 AH slots expiry at 30 days. Mounts that can be purchased from NPCs once the chocobo license is unlocked. They'll be hidden in various vendors so you'll have to hunt for them.

# Demiurge:

This server intends to "level up" and enable expansion content in stages, as happened with retail. It is presently 75 capped and stops at Chains of Promathia. There is heavy customization, with a lot of stuff that doesn't exist in any version of the retail game. Custom monster, NMs, NPCs, and seasonal events, even made up systems and game mechanics. The owner values creativity over adherence to any past era of the game.
