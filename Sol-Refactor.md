## Introduction
Towards the end of Project Topaz, we were planning on writing a nice "year in review" article presenting all of the things we had developed and released with the community's help over the past year. Unfortunately, Project Topaz folded and I don't feel like it's appropriate to present that type of article now that we're operating under a different name. Alongside this article we had proof of concepts and early implementations of important architectural work that was 95% ready to roll out. We've since rewritten that work and taken it to completion! We no longer have to hint at the cool stuff we're working on in a secret Discord, in a secret repo. It's ready for you to use **today**!

**Summary:**
> We've gutted the entire system that links C++ to Lua, replacing it with the excellent Sol framework

There are a lot of things enabled by this work that might not be easily digestible by non-developers, so this article is an attempt to explain why this work has taken priority over everything else, and why you'll soon be reaping the benefits!

There is a mini technical guide to using Sol [here](https://github.com/topaz-next/topaz/wiki/Sol-Lua-Binding-Library).

This work was originally planned to be executed over the course of 2x 6-week stages, but the first stage was so successful we rolled the second one into it to deliver them together. 

I'd also like to extend my extreme thanks to Wren and claywar, for absolutely annihilating any estimates I had for when this work would be complete. We're literally _months_ ahead of schedule because of their bonkers work ethics!

## Motivation

### Runtime Safety

Unless handled very carefully, if an error is encountered in C++; it will kill the server. Unless you're debugging or you're set up correctly to capture crash information this crash will be difficult to diagnose. Even if you catch the crash, it can be hard to understand or fix unless you're comfortable with C++.

If an error is encountered in Lua it will log all the information it has and then bail out of the current script; allowing the C++ execution to continue underneath it, leaving the server alive.

The more errors we can catch in the Lua layer before they make it into C++, the less crashes there'll be. 

An added benefit of using Sol is that it validates the use of bindings at the Lua level. If you call `mob:takeDamage(x)`, but `mob` or `x` are nil/invalid; it won't make it into the C++. It'll log an error and operation will continue.

### Runtime Performance

Every time a script is run (for the most part) it will be freshly read off the disk, regardless of if it has been read before. You can read about the comp-sci details [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hierarchy), but briefly; reading a file off disk is much much slower than reading it from memory. Every Player, NPC, and Mob who is currently active will be constantly calling and loading Lua scripts from the disk. The performance cost of this adds up very quickly and can get out of hand, rendering your server unresponsive. Using an SSD or other high-performance storage can ease the load a bit, but doesn't erase the issue.

With the new design, scripts are read once at startup, and their various function calls are cached in memory. This leads to a very significant improvement in lookup and execution time:

`The fabled 20x performance improvement`

_This work was/is possible without using Sol, but it is MUCH harder to pull off. It was made nearly trivial to implement by leaning on Sol._

The one benefit of the old system was the ability to hot-swap and modify scripts on-the-fly. If it's being read all the time, any changes you make will get picked up and used immediately - leading to a very short iteration cycle. This is a feature we absolutely couldn't have dropped, it's vital for anyone wanting to write scripts. We've kept this functionality by adding a `FileWatcher`; this will inform the server process if anything in the `scripts/` folder has changed during operation and re-cache it. This functionality is enabled by default for Debug builds, and disabled in Release builds.

```

### Developer Quality of Life

All interaction between Lua and C++ before was handled manually. You would have to push and pull items off of the Lua stack, make sure you left the stack in a sane state when you were done, constantly query the state of the stack, register function pointers, validate all arguments coming in and out of your bindings etc. It was scary for newcomers, and never got any less fiddly or fragile for people who were familiar with it.

Using Sol to handle C++/Lua interop is the difference between trying to clean your living-room floor with a blowtorch, or turning on your Roomba. It's a night-and-day difference.

## What does this mean for my server?
This is a huge breaking change. Every single binding has been rewritten, every single mob and effect script has been modified. We recommend you take our repo and re-apply your custom changes over the top of it. Unless you have more time than sense, you won't be able to merge this into your current branches.

If you have custom bindings, there should be enough examples of the new style to allow you to convert them without much effort.

## Small Warning
Does this mean calling Lua is faster, easier, and more efficient? Yes. Absolutely. 

Does this mean we should start cramming everything into Lua indiscriminately? **No.** Lua, Luajit (our fast version of Lua), and Sol are wonderful tools, but they are not a replacement for the sheer heavy lifting power of C++, or the storage/querying power of SQL. This work doesn't turn on some kind of "everything should be in Lua now" switch. Make the same choices you would have before, so that we can use these performance gains to carry the project into the future!

## Other Goodies
Content contributions are now OPEN*! ðŸŽ‰

_***Please** keep in mind we're still a small crew, and one of the reasons Project Topaz folded was the stress of constantly bending over backwards to please contributors._

This work is licensed under [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/topaz-next/topaz/blob/release/LICENSE), the same license as everything else. There are no additional hoops to jump through or things to worry about. Use it with our blessing! _(but please don't try and pass it off as your own work)_

This work enables basic Lua modules. If you know what you're doing, you can start writing them _today_ by overwriting cache entries. If you're not sure, we'll have some examples out sometime soon.
