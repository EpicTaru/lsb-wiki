Server has been in operation since 2013, and operates on a dedicated box on a 50 Down/50 Up Fiber Optic line. Its fast, stable, and loads of fun.

Super fast leveling, and some fun commands.

# Canaria:
Focus of this server is to have a good time, have access to the latest features of Project Topaz, and enjoy the quality of life improvements (book/crystal teleport, ground/field of valor) that make this game fun to play in small or long sessions.

Level cap restriction is set in place as most of the content past level 75 has not really been implemented.

All content comes from the [canary branch](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/tree/canary), no custom modifications are in place.
