New server--reborn from Resolute--doing an official launch on 05/06/2020 at 2:30pm PST (further details on discord), and run on a privately owned and operated dedicated server.

Admins and players alike continue to make contributions back to Project Topaz, with a focus on era-content that Gold Saucer is building.

* **Jobs:** All jobs up to TOAU unlocked for new players, DNC and SCH are available to unlock by normal means.
