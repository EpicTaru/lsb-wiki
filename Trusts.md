### This page is only for tracking Trust combat logic, not whether they obtainable or not. This assumes you have access to them through GM commands or otherwise (`!addalltrusts`).

## General Notes
- All mages are very MP-hungry
- Spell selection is very simple
- Trusts don't track if their spells were resisted, or if they might get resisted
